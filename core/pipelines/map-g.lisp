(defmacro map-g (pipeline-func stream &rest uniforms)
  ;; the map-g context has to be a gensym containing the name
  ;; MAPG-CTX this is a hacky but reliable way to check if the
  ;; pipeline is being called from map-g. Of course someone can
  ;; go out of their way to trick us but at that point they are
  ;; already playing with fire.
  ;;
  ;; If you are reading this trying to work out how to call your
  ;; pipeline without map-g, DONT! this is one of the things that
  ;; allows cepl to perform a bunch of optimizations and change
  ;; api internals without breaking people's code.
  ;; If you have a usecase where map-g is a problem please raise an
  ;; issue on github
