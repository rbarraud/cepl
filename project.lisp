This function is a simple way to make a lisp project with all the
supporting libraries to get up and running with cepl quickly.

It uses the excellent quickproject project, so before starting be sure
to run the following in your repl:

    (ql:quickload :quickproject)

By default it assumes you want to use sdl2, skitter and dirt, and that
you will be using slime as the communication layer between lisp and your editor.

Valid values for the :repl argument are currently :slime or :slynk.
